## Properties of Functions

- Write a function to check whether an inputted function is onto. The python function should be called is onto, should take in the 3 arguments representing the function (domain, co-domain, and mapping), and should return a boolean, True or False.
- Write a function to check whether an inputted function is one-to-one. The python function should be called is one to one, should take in the 3 arguments representing the function (domain, co-domain, and mapping), and should return a boolean, True or False.
- Write a function to check whether an inputted function is bijective. (Hint: you can utilize your other functions in writing this one!) The python function should be called is bijective, should take in the 3 arguments representing the function (domain, co-domain, and mapping) and should return a boolean, True or False.
